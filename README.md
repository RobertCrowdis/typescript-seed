# Welcome to Typescript!
I created this project as a fast start for colleagues (and myself) to get started with Typescript.

## How to get started:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Node installed on your computer, and that all the following commands are run in the `./typescript-seed` directory.

2. Open a new terminal / Windows Shell. Type `npm install` to grab all dependencies. This project will install **Nodemon**, a nifty tool that will rebuild your project every time you save it.
>Typescript must be transposed into Javascript. By default, you use `npm build FILENAME` on a target file. However, **Nodemon** will take care of this for us!

3. Type `npm watch` to get **Nodemon** running. **Make sure you keep this terminal open!** 
>If you close the window, Nodemon will stop working, and you will have to run `npm watch` again.

4. Add and create any amount of .ts files inside the `./typescript-seed/src`. They will be converted into .js files and placed inside of `./typescript-seed/dist`

5. Happy Coding! :octocat:
